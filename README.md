A Java web application for banking operations with support for both file-based and database storage.

## Prerequisites

- Java 23 or higher
- Apache Tomcat 10
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench (for database setup)
- Maven

## Project Setup

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Open MySQL Workbench
   - Run the provided SQL query to create the database
   - Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/database.properties`:
     ```properties
     username=your_username
     password=your_password
     ```

2. **Project Structure**
   - The project uses a dual-layer DAO (Data Access Object) architecture:
     - File-based DAO layer for file storage operations
     - Database DAO layer for MySQL database operations
   - You can switch between file and database storage by configuring the appropriate DAO implementation

3. **Build and Deploy**
   - Build the project using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
